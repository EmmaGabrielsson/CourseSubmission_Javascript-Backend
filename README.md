## Course Submission Javascript-Backend 

Here I have created a singlepage application with React using javascrpit. The application fetch movies from the TMDB-API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and includes:

- a searchbar were you can search after all matching movies,
- a frontpage that displays popular movies and their title and rating in a sidescroll function,
- an onClick function on movie-title that navigates you to the current movie page with more info,
- a placeholder for recently viewed movies that displays the users five last visited movie-pages,

- a watchlist, were the user can add movies to a saved list to remember what movies to watch later
